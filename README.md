# VRDataInteract

VR Data Interact is a virtual reality software application that was developed using the Unity game engine **(V5.6.3f1)** with the support of SteamVR and VRTK assets libraries (Unity plugins). It allows the end user to import 3D models in an OBJ format. Two of its main features are the Stack Interact menu and the Object Interact menu. The former is customized for electron microscopy z stacks that corresponds with the reconstructed 3D models (targeted for import in VR). This features allows neuroscientist to proofread their models, as well as conduct explorative analysis by correlating the imported 3D model with its surrounding structures in the corresponding 2D EM slice.
The application is equipped with a demo model that includes 4 cellular/intracellular structures: a Glia, axons, dendrites, and glycogen granules.
The block diagrams below represents two use case scenarios for importing an object and for importing an entire z stack for the purpose of analysis and data interaction.
